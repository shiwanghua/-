This document is for you if you don't know anything about TeX or 
LaTeX, but want to see what is involved.  For instance, maybe you
are a graduate student who has been advised to try writing document
using LaTeX.

It brings you through writing a document of a couple of pages, 
involving both plain text and mathematics, and should only 
take a couple of hours.  At the end you will have an idea if
the system could help you, and there are a couple of recommendations
for tutorials.
